# hotel-booking

### A small project implementing simple hotel booking functionality. It uses Grails and AngularJS.
##### The Grails back-end represents a REST API that is used by AngularJS. There're 3 domain classes - Guest, Booking and Room, together with controllers.
##### On the AngularJS side, there's a newBooking directive that implements a UI for creating a new booking.
